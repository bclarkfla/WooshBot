# WooshBot
A Reddit bot written in Python3 running in AWS Lambda. It's triggered by a CloudWatch event every 24 hours to read the most recent comments on the Doughboys subreddit. It checks if it's a commenter's cakeday and, if so, posts a link to the Youtube video of the Birthday Boys Woosh sketch.
